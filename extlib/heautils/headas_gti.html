<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
This module contains routines which are used to create, manipulate,
read and write "good time intervals" or GTIs.  A GTI contains
information about a set of time intervals, which are typically useful
for astronomy data processing.  For example, a GTI usually contains
information about exposure start and stop times.  This module has
routines which interface with standard FITS-format GTI files.

<p>
The primary data structure used by this module is the gti_struct
structure, which is defined here:
<pre>

     struct gti_struct {
       double mjdref;       /* MJD Reference time of GTI */
       double timezero;     /* Timezero time offset of GTI */
       int ngti;            /* Number of occupied time values */
       int maxgti;          /* Maximum amount of time values */
       double *start, *stop;/* Pointer to start[] and stop[] arrays */
       void *dptr;          /* Raw data storage pointer */
     };
</pre>
Most of these fields correspond to time-specific keywords within 
FITS GTI files.  

<p>
The user is responsible for allocating a gti_struct structure using
malloc or some other suitable means.  There are two ways to initialze
the data structure.  The function HDgti_init() can be used to
initialize a structure to a consistent empty state. An initialized
structure begins life empty with no internal storage.  Alternatively,
the HDgti_copy() function can be used to duplicate an existing GTI
structure into an uninitialized destination data structure.

<p>
The function HDgti_free() is used to deallocate any internal storage
and must be called by the user before de-allocating the gti structure
itself.

<p>
A GTI may be enlarged using HDgti_grow(), where the user specifies the
new maximum amount of storage.  Thus, the standard life-cylce for a
GTI will be something like this:
<pre>
       {
         struct gti_struct gti;  /* or allocate with malloc() */
         HDgti_init(&amp;gti);       /* initialize structure */
         HDgti_grow(&amp;gti, ngti, &amp;status); /* grow to desired size */
         /*  ..... process with GTI ..... */
         HDgti_free(&amp;gti);
         /* de-allocate "gti" with free() if appropriate */
       }
</pre>

<p>
The function HDgti_read() is used to initialize a GTI
structure using the contents of existing FITS GTI extension.  The file
should be formatted according to the OGIP/93-003 memo, "The Proposed
Timing FITS File Format for High Energy Astrophysics Data."  The
MJDREF and TIMEZERO keywords should be present in the requested
extension.  If they are not present, the default value is assumed to
be zero.

<p>
The function HDgti_write() is used to write a GTI structure as a new
FITS extension.  The file must exist and be open for writing.

<p>
The utility routine HDget_frac_time() can be used to read keyword that
can potentially be stored either as the complete value or as integer
and fractional components.  For example the reference time value can
either be stored as MJDREF (complete numerical result) or two
keywords, MJDREFI and MJDREFF, representing the integer and fractional
components.  HDget_frac_time() attempts both alternatives and returns
the results.

<p>
This module also supports manipulation and tabulation capabilities for
GTI structures.

<p>
The HDgti_exp() function calculates the overlap exposure time between
a requested start and stop time and a given GTI structure.

<p>
The HDgti_where() function computes which GTI time interval a
requested event falls into, or -1 if the event time does not fall into
any interval.

<p>
The HDgti_merge() function performs a merging function between two GTI
structures.  The merge can either be an "intersection" (GTI_AND)
operation, which represents the overlapping intervals that occur in
both GTI structures; or a "union" (GTI_OR) operation, which represents
the intervals which occur in either one GTI structure or the other.

<p>
The HDgti_clean() function takes as input a GTI structure and performs
sanity check operations.  After "cleaning" the GTI structure will be
in time order with duplicate and overlapping time intervals removed.
I.e. there will be no redundant intervals and two overlapping
intervals will be joined into one.

DETAILED DOCUMENTATION
</h2>

<h3>
HDgti_init
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_init - initialize GTI structure

Intializes an already-existing GTI structure.  It is assumed that
no memory needs to be deallocated.

struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure.

RETURNS: status code
</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_free
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_free - deallocate memory associated with GTI structure

Deallocates memory pointed to by GTI structure.  The structure
itself is not deallocated, but any time intervals are.
The structure is then initialized to zeroes.

struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure.

RETURNS: status code

</pre>


<h3>
HDgti_copy
</h3>
<pre>
HDgti_copy - deep copy GTI from one structure to another

Perform deep copy of GTI from source to destination structures.
The structures must already have been allocated; the contents are
then transferred.

struct gti_struct *dest - pointer to existing GTI structure, dest of copy
struct gti_struct *src - pointer to existing GTI structure, source of copy
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 

</pre>

<h3>
HDget_frac_time
</h3>
<pre>

HDget_frac_time - get (potentially) fractional time keyword from FITS header

Some OGIP FITS timing values are allowed to be specified either as
a single keyword, or a pair of keywords which gives integer and
fractional values which are to be added.  This allows maximum time
precision.  For example, for the observation starting time, it can
either be found by:

                                 RETURNS    *vali     *valf
   TSTART  - single value        TSTART     TSTART    0

   TSTARTI - integer value       TSTARTI+F  TSTARTI   TSTARTF
   TSTARTF - fractional value

This routine read a FITS timing keyword(s).  The returned values
are given above.  If the user passes null values for vali and/or
valf, then HDget_frac_time will gracefully skip storing those values.

fitsfile *fileptr - open FITS file pointer, open to HDU where
                    keywords are to be found
char *key - keyword name, "TSTART", "TIMEZERO", etc.
double *vali - upon return, and if vali is not null, then the whole
               number of seconds is stored in *vali.
double *valf - upon return, and if valf is not null, then the fractional
               number of seconds is stored in *valf.
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: (TSTART) or (TSTARTI+TSTARTF)


</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_grow
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_grow - enlarge the storage of an existing GTI structure

Takes an existing GTI structure, and enlarges it to a new size,
i.e., increases the maximum number of GTI rows that can be stored
in the structure.  

The storage can never shrink.  Thus, users can call this function
whenever they anticipate needing a certain number of GTI rows.  The
existing values will be preserved.

HDgti_grow() handles the case where the GTI structure has been
initialized and has no allocated storage associated with it, yet.

struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure, to be
                          enlarged.
int new - new maximum number of rows of storage which gti should contain.
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 

</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_read
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_read - read a GTI extension from a FITS file

Reads a GTI extension from a FITS file.  If filename is non-NULL,
then HDgti_read will open the specified file name (and optional
extension name).  If filename is NULL, then it is assumed that the
file is already open, and a CFITSIO file handle is available in
(*fptr).  

Upon return, if fptr is non-NULL, the file will remain open and
*fptr will be a CFITSIO file handle.  Otherwise, the file will be
closed.

HDgti_read() will search for the first extension matching the
extname parameter.  Set extename="*" to match the first extension
of the open file.

The user can choose the column names to read.  The user can also
provide a reference GTI.  If the two GTIs have different timezero
values, then the times of the new gti are adjusted to match the
timezero value of the refer_to GTI.


char *filename - name of FITS file to read (including CFITSIO syntax),
                 or NULL
struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure, to be
                         filled with data from FITS file.
char *extname - name of extension,    or 0 for default of "GTI"
                (set extname="*" to use first open table extension)
char *start   - name of START column, or 0 for default of "*START*"
char *stop    - name of STOP column,  or 0 for default of "*STOP*"
struct gti_struct *refer_to - pointer to existing GTI structure.
fitsfile **fptr - three cases:
   fptr == 0: 
       HDgti_read will open filename, and close it before returning
   fptr != 0 and filename != NULL: 
       HDgti_read will open filename, file will remain open, and
       (*fptr) contains the CFITSIO handle of open file
   fptr != 0 and filename == NULL: 
       HDgti_read assumes file is already open, and
       (*fptr) contains the CFITSIO handle of open file
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code
</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_write
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_write - create a GTI extension and write it

Writes a GTI extension to a FITS file.  A binary table is created
and populated with the gti "gti".  Basic OGIP GTI keywords are
written.

The file is left open upon return so that users may manipulate the
header afterwards.

The units are assumed to be seconds.  The user can choose the
extname, and column names to write.


fitsfile *fptr - already-open FITS file, open for writing
struct gti_struct *gti - populated GTI structure, to be written to fptr
char *extname - name of extension, or 0 for default of "STDGTI"
char *start - name of START column, or 0 for default of "START"
char *stop - name of STOP column, or 0 for default of "STOP"
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 

</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_merge
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_merge - merge two GTIs either using intersection or union

Merges two different good time interval lists.  If the mode is
GTI_AND, then the intersection between the two lists is determined.
If the mode is GTI_OR, then the union between the two lists is
found.

This routine is based heavily on the fortran version, taken from
the HEASARC extractor (gtilib.f).

int mode - merging mode, either GTI_AND or GTI_OR
struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure, result of merge
struct gti_struct *agti - pointer to existing GTI structure, 1st input GTI
struct gti_struct *bgti - pointer to existing GTI structure, 2nd input GTI
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 

</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_clean
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_clean - clean a GTI by sorting, removing duplicates, overlaps

HDgti_clean:  Sort a gti list and remove invalid and overlapping
  intervals by calling HDgti_merge to OR it with nothing.

This routine is based heavily on the fortran version, taken from
the HEASARC extractor.

struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure, result of clean
struct gti_struct *ogti - pointer to existing GTI structure, to be cleaned
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 

</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_exp
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_exp - compute overlap exposure of a time bin with GTI

Exposure: What part of the time interval (t1, t2) is contained
within the Good Time Intervals?  (For the fractional exposure, just
divide gtiexp by (t2-t1).)

 NOTE: It is *VITAL* that the GTI list be ordered and
    contain no overlaps!  If in doubt, call HDgti_clean first.
    also, we assume that t1, t2, and the gti list are all
    in the same units.

One difference from the FORTRAN version is that if there are no
good time intervals (i.e. gti-&gt;ngti == 0), then zero is returned
here.  In the FORTRAN version, the whole exposure is returned.

double t1 - start of time bin.
double t2 - stop of time bin.  (note: t1 &lt; t2)
struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure, whose
       overlap with the time bin is to be computed.
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: overlap exposure 
</pre>

<h3>
HDgti_where
</h3>
<pre>

HDgti_where - which good time intervals a set of times falls into

HDgti_where examines an array of times, and determines which good time
intervals the times fall into.  This routine is most highly
optimized for times which are sorted in time order.

An interval of -1 indicates a time that does not fall into a good
time interval.

struct gti_struct *gti - pointer to existing GTI structure.
int ntimes - size of times array.
double *times - an ntimes-element array, times to be examined.
int *segs - an ntimes-element array.  Upon return, the values give 
  which good time interval the time falls into:
   (times[i] &gt;= gti->start[segs[i]]) &amp;&amp; (times[i] &lt; gti-&gt;stop[segs[i]])
  or, if segs[i] is -1, the time does not fall into a GTI
int *status - pointer to status variable

RETURNS: status code 
</pre>
