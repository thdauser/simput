.SH NAME
tofits \- Turn a list of keyrecords to a valid FITS file
.SH DESCRIPTION
tofits turns a list of FITS header keyrecords, one per line, into a proper
FITS header by padding them with blanks to 80 characters and stripping out
newline characters.  It also pads the header to an integral number of 2880\-
byte blocks if necessary.
.PP
The input byte stream is assumed to be ASCII\-encoded.  Characters outside
the set of text characters allowed by FITS (ASCII 0x20 to 0x7E) are ignored
with the sole exception that a byte with value 0xA0 (non\-breaking space in
all variants of ISO/IEC 8859) is translated to an ordinary space (0x20).
Thus input encoded in ISO/IEC 8859 or UTF\-8 should be interpreted correctly,
with any illegal characters in keycomments simply being ignored.
.PP
tofits has no options and operates as a filter, reading from stdin and
writing to stdout, e.g.
.IP
tofits < infile > outfile
.PP
Input lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments.
