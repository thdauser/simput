wcsgrid \- Extract FITS WCS keywords and plot graticule
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wcsgrid
[\fI-a<alt>\fR] [\fI-d<pgdev>\fR] [\fI-h<hdu>\fR] [\fI<fitsfile>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wcsgrid extracts the WCS keywords for an image from the specified FITS
file and uses pgsbox() to plot a 2\-D coordinate graticule for each
alternate representation found.
.PP
The FITS file may be specified according to the syntax understood by
cfitsio, for example "file.fits.gz+1" refers to the first extension of
a gzip'd FITS file.  Use "\-" or omit the file name for input from stdin.
.SH OPTIONS
