.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
wcsgrid extracts the WCS keywords for an image from the specified FITS
file and uses pgsbox() to plot a 2\-D coordinate graticule for each
alternate representation found.
.PP
The FITS file may be specified according to the syntax understood by
cfitsio, for example "file.fits.gz+1" refers to the first extension of
a gzip'd FITS file.  Use "\-" or omit the file name for input from stdin.
