.SH NAME
HPXcvt \- Reorganise HEALPix data into a 2-D FITS image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B HPXcvt
[\fI-C<col>\fR] [\fI-c<sys>\fR] [\fI-n|-r\fR] [\fI-q<quad>\fR] [\fI-x<n|s>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
[<infile> [<outfile>]]
.PP
HPXcvt reorganises HEALPix data into a 2\-D FITS image with HPX coordinate
system.  The input data may be stored in a FITS file as a primary image
or image extension, or as a binary table extension.  Both NESTED and RING
pixel indices are supported.  The input and output files may be omitted or
specified as "\-" to indicate stdin and stdout respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-C\fR<col>
Binary table column number from which to read data,
default 1 (n.b. WMAP exclusion masks are in column 2).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR<sys>
Specify the coordinate system to be used to label the
output map if the COORDSYS keyword is absent from the input
FITS header.  Recognised values are g (galactic),
e (ecliptic) or q (equatorial).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR|\-r
Assume n(ested) or r(ing) organization if the ORDERING
keyword is absent from the input FITS header.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR<quad>
Recentre longitude at quad(mod 4) x 90 degrees, where
quad(rant) is an integer.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR<n|s>
Use a north\-polar or south\-polar layout (XPH).
